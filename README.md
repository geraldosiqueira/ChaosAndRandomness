# ChaosAndRandomness

### Iterative Maps and Chaos Quantification
Observe and analyze nonlinearity and chaos in a simple iterative model. 
Equation used: xn+1 = f(xn) = rxn(1 âˆ’ xn)
Analysing fixed points, periods and chaos folding, bifurcation diagrams, sensitivity to initial conditions and Lyapunov exponents.

### Random number sequences
Distribution of random numbers, random walks, and brownian motion
